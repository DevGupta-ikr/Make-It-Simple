# Make It Simple

Hey there!

I came across this saying that if you cannot explain a comcept to a six year old, you have not understood it yourself.

It has since then been a challenge to me to explain concepts I learnt to someone in the simpleast way possible.

Hence this Repository is made for this purpose.
